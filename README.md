# How to run this model for development for now.

```

2. Move to the lmri_uvcgan directory
```bash
cd lmri_uvcgan
```

3. Create a virtual environment using anaconda
```bash
conda create --name lmri python=3.10
```

4. Activate the virtual environment using conda

6. If you check your branches using

* leo
  main
```
